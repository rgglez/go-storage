# GSP-73: Organization Rename

## Background

After voting on the [Organization Name Changing Proposal], our organization has been renamed to `Beyond Storage`. With this change, all our repositories don't match with the new name, and some links couldn't access anymore.

## Proposal

So I propose that all our repositories should reflect this change.

- Organization name or address should be updated in infrastructure.
- Module names, dependencies and related references should be updated in services.
- Organization information and related name should be updated in docs.
- Outside links should be accessed normally.

## Rationale
N/A

## Compatibility
All services, applications and infrastructure could be affected.

## Implementation
