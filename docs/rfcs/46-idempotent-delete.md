# AOS-46: Idempotent Storager Delete Operation

## Background

After [AOS-25] has been introduced, we use `Delete` to handle all object delete operations. But their behavior is not well-defined:

- File system alike service may return `not exist` for object that not exist.
- Object storage alike service always return success no matter the object exist or not.

The problem is much more serious for `multipart` and `append` object:

- For `fs` and `qingstor`, `append` object is exist and readable once they have been created.
- For `dropbox`, `append` object is exist and readable after they have been `CommitAppend`.

If user tried to delete an `append` object, he will get errors under `dropbox`.

## Proposal

So I propose to make Storager's `Delete` operation idempotent.

`idempotent` means:

- Without outside changes, `Delete` operation could be executed on the same path multiple times and always get the same results.
- `Delete` operation will not return `ObjectNotExist` anymore.

For service provider:

- Don't NEED to check the file exist or not.
- SHOULD omit `ObjectNotExist` related error. (Especially for `multipart` and `append` object)

## Rationale

### Alternative Way: Make sure ObjectNotExist returned

The alternative way is make `Delete` more strict: no matter what the object mode is, we always check the object before delete them.

For object storage service, we need to `stat` object and return ObjectNotExist directly if stat returns ObjectNotExist.

This will need extra requests.

### What if user wants to know whether a file has been deleted or not?

User can stat the object by self before delete, or we can provide an operation called `CheckedDelete(path string) (deleted bool, err error)` in another interface.

### Corner Cases

`dropbox` returns a `upload-session-id` for `create_append` operation, the file is visitable after `commit_append`.

So:

- If there is an object exist, the `delete` operation could delete it by mistake.
- If the object returned by `create_append` is missing, user could not resume the uploads.

## Compatibility

For `fs` and `dropbox`: `Delete` will not return `ObjectNotExist` anymore. 

## Implementation

- Update [go-integration-test](https://github.com/rgglez/go-integration-test)
  - Add a case that delete an object twice, and should not meet error.
- Make sure all service implement delete correctly.
