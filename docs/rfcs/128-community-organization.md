# GSP-128: Community Organization

## Background

BeyondStorage has been grown up, and we need to define our community organization to make it clear that everyone's rights and responsibilities.

## Proposal

I propose to add five positions for BeyondStorage, and they are separate in different projects.

For now, there are following projects:

- `go-storage`: Focus on implement storage abstraction for golang, including `go-storage`, `go-service-*`, `go-endpoint` and so on.
- `dm`: Focus on implement data migration services, including `dm`.
- `specs`: Focus on the specs of BeyondStorage, new ideas, new proposals happened here, including `specs`.
- `community`: Focus on the development of BeyondStorage community, including `site`, `community` and tools like `go-community`.
